| Hey I am not feeling good                                                  | I'm glad you reached out. It takes a lot of courage to talk about not feeling good. Can you tell me a bit more about what's been going on and how you've been feeling lately? Sometimes just sharing what's on your mind can help clarify things.                                                                                                   | 1.029517650604248   |
| Yeah, I just feel really drained and unmotivated. Even the things I used to enjoy don’t seem interesting anymore. I don’t know what’s wrong, but it’s been like this for a while. | I'm here to listen and help you understand what might be going on. It sounds like you're feeling quite disconnected from things that usually bring you joy. That can be really tough. I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share these feelings with someone. Can you tell me more about what you've been experiencing over the past while? When did you first notice this change in your motivation and energy levels? | 1.3068487644195557  |
| I think it started a few weeks ago, but I’m not sure exactly when. I just remember feeling more tired than usual, and then over time, everything started feeling like a chore—even small things. I try to push through, but it’s like I have no energy or interest. | It sounds like you're really struggling to find the energy and motivation to do things that usually bring you joy. Feeling like everything is a chore can be really overwhelming. Let's try to break down what you're experiencing a bit more. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "tired" feeling? Was it more physical, mental, or emotional exhaustion? | 0.8759522438049316  |
| I think it’s mostly mental and emotional. Physically, I don’t feel sick or anything, but my mind just feels heavy all the time. Even when I get enough sleep, I still wake up feeling exhausted. It’s like my brain doesn’t get a break, and I can’t focus on anything properly. | It sounds like you're experiencing a significant amount of mental and emotional fatigue, even when you're getting enough rest. This heaviness in your mind can make it challenging to focus on tasks and maintain motivation. Before we move forward, I want to acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to share these feelings. Can I check if you're experiencing any suicidal thoughts or feelings, as mentioned in the context earlier? | 0.8980891704559326  |
| No, I don’t think so. It’s not that I want to hurt myself—I just feel stuck, like I’m running on empty. I don’t know how to get out of this cycle. | I completely understand how you feel stuck and running on empty. It's like you've lost your energy and motivation. That can be a really challenging place to be. I'm here to listen and help you explore what might be contributing to these feelings. To help me understand what's going on, can you tell me more about what you mean by 'running on empty'? Is there something specific that's been draining your energy, or do you feel like it's just a general sense of exhaustion? | 1.7177996635437012  |
| It’s more of a general exhaustion, but I think stress might be a big part of it. There’s just so much on my plate, and no matter how much I try to push through, it never feels like enough. I guess I just feel overwhelmed. | I can sense your frustration and feeling of being overwhelmed. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share these emotions with someone. It sounds like you're experiencing burnout, which is a common issue for many of us. Before we go further, I want to check in with you: Are there any specific sources of stress or things on your plate that you think might be contributing to your feelings of exhaustion? For example, work, relationships, or other responsibilities? | 1.3661997318267822  |
| Yeah, I think it’s a mix of everything—work, personal life, and just the pressure to keep up with everything. It’s like no matter what I do, there’s always more to handle, and I never really get a break. | It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed and burdened by the demands in your life. It's understandable to feel like no matter how much you accomplish, there's always more to handle. This sense of being "behind" or "not keeping up" can be really stressful. Can you tell me more about what's been going on with work and personal life that's contributing to these feelings of overwhelm? Are there any specific situations or events that have been particularly challenging for you? | 0.9161851406097412  |
| I appreciate you listening. I think I just needed to get this off my chest. I’ll try to take things one step at a time and see how I can manage. Thanks for talking with me. | It sounds like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders after sharing your feelings with me. I'm glad I could provide a supportive space for you to express yourself. Taking things one step at a time is a great approach to managing your emotions and daily responsibilities. Remember, it's okay to take small steps towards healing and self-care. Are you feeling more grounded and in control, or are there still some emotional ups and downs you're experiencing? | 1.0053458213806152  |

| Hey I am not feeling good                                                  | I'm so sorry to hear that you're not feeling good. It takes a lot of courage to reach out and talk about how you're feeling. Can you tell me a little bit more about what's been going on and what's been on your mind lately? Don't worry, everything we discuss is confidential and I'm here to listen. This is the beginning of our conversation, so we can take our time to get a better understanding of what's going on. | 1.0358784198760986  |
| Yeah, I just feel really drained and unmotivated. Even the things I used to enjoy don’t seem interesting anymore. I don’t know what’s wrong, but it’s been like this for a while. | It sounds like you're feeling stuck and disconnected from things that used to bring you joy. That can be a really tough and isolating experience. Can you tell me a bit more about what you mean by "drained and unmotivated"? Is it a constant feeling, or is it something that comes and goes?                                                                 | 1.083448886871338   |
| I think it started a few weeks ago, but I’m not sure exactly when. At first, I just felt more tired than usual, and over time, everything started feeling like a chore—even small things. I try to push through, but it’s like I have no energy or interest. | It sounds like you've been experiencing a significant shift in how you're feeling lately. The fatigue and lack of energy are understandable, but the fact that even small, enjoyable activities have become uninteresting is a bit concerning. This can be a sign of a deeper issue. I want to assure you that we're here to explore these feelings together, and I'm committed to creating a safe space for you to express yourself. | 0.804175853729248   |
| Lately, my days feel repetitive and exhausting. I wake up already feeling drained, and even simple tasks like getting out of bed or starting work feel like a struggle. I try to go through my routine—work, chores, maybe talking to a few people—but it all feels forced. I don’t really feel present in anything I do, and by the end of the day, I just feel even more exhausted. | I'm so glad you felt comfortable sharing your feelings with me. It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially when our daily routines can start to feel monotonous and overwhelming. It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of emotional and physical exhaustion, which can be really challenging to navigate. To better understand your situation, I'd like to ask a few more questions. Can you tell me more about what you mean by feeling "drained" when you wake up? Is there a specific time when you started feeling this way, or has it been a gradual process? | 0.7161169052124023  |
| It’s been a gradual process—I can’t pinpoint exactly when it started, but it feels like it’s been building up over time. When I wake up, I already feel exhausted, like I didn’t get any real rest. It’s not just physical tiredness; it’s like my mind is worn out before the day even begins. I think that’s what makes everything feel so difficult to push through. | I can sense the sense of exhaustion and fatigue you're experiencing, and it's understandable that it feels like it's been building up over time. It's not just the physical aspect but also the mental wear and tear that's making daily tasks feel overwhelming. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and share these feelings, so thank you for trusting me with this conversation. Can you tell me more about your sleep patterns lately? Have you noticed any changes in the quality or duration of your sleep? | 0.9586503505706787  |
| That makes sense. I guess I hadn’t really put it into words before, but you’re right—it’s not just physical exhaustion, it’s the mental weight too. I appreciate you listening. Maybe I do need to take a step back and reflect on what’s been contributing to this. | It's completely understandable that you're feeling this way, and it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and express your emotions. Recognizing the mental weight is a huge step forward. I'd like to help you explore this further. Let's transition to the **Exploration** stage. Can you tell me more about what you mean by the "mental weight"? What specific thoughts, emotions, or situations do you feel are contributing to this feeling? | 0.8139760494232178  |
| I appreciate you listening and helping me reflect on this. I think I need some time to process everything we've talked about. Thank you for your support—I’ll check in again when I’m ready. | It's completely understandable that you need some time to process everything we've discussed so far. Taking care of yourself and allowing yourself space to reflect is vital in this process. I want you to know that my door is always open for you to reach out when you're ready. You can take as much time as you need, and I'll be here to support you. | 1.0701277256011963  |
| Thank you, I really appreciate your support. I’ll take some time to process everything, and I’ll reach out again if I need to talk. Take care. | It was my pleasure to support you, and I'm glad we could have this conversation. Please take all the time you need to reflect on your thoughts and feelings. When you're ready, I'll be here to continue our conversation and work together to establish a plan to support your well-being. | 0.9754359722137451  |
