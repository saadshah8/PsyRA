| "I've been feeling really down lately, and it's been hard to shake off this sense of sadness. I often feel unmotivated, and even the things I used to enjoy don't bring me happiness anymore. I've also been struggling with negative thoughts, and it feels like they just won't stop. I'm not sure what's causing it, but I just feel overwhelmed." | "I'm so sorry to hear that you're experiencing these feelings. It sounds like you're going through a really tough time. I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you, and I want you to feel comfortable sharing as much or as little as you'd like. It sounds like you're struggling with some pretty intense emotions, including sadness, unmotivation, and negative thoughts. That can be really overwhelming.

| "I think a lot of it started when I began feeling disconnected from the people around me. I've been isolating myself more, and even when I'm with friends or family, I still feel alone. Work or school has also been really stressful, and I feel like no matter how much I do, it's never enough. Lately, I've been overthinking a lot—dwelling on past mistakes and worrying about the future. It's exhausting, and I don't know how to stop these thoughts from taking over." | "It sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed and disconnected from others, which can be a really tough and isolating experience. It's understandable that you're struggling to cope with these feelings, especially with the added stress of work or school. Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'feeling disconnected' from the people around you? Is there a specific situation or event that triggered this feeling, or has it been a gradual process? Additionally, what do you think might be the root cause of these negative thoughts and worries?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 0.6                    | 0.6             | `get_relevant_context: 0.05s, 643 tokens`<br>`summarize_conversation: 0.69s, 91 tokens`<br>`chain_invoke: 0.79s, 117 tokens` |
| "I'm not sure exactly when it started, but I've noticed that even when I'm with my friends or family, I feel distant—like I'm just going through the motions instead of really connecting. Conversations feel surface-level, and I struggle to open up because I don't think they'd understand what I'm going through. I think part of it comes from past experiences where I tried to express how I felt, and it didn't go well. Either I was dismissed, or I felt like a burden. So now, I just keep everything inside. Over time, it's made me feel more isolated, like no one really knows the real me. As for the negative thoughts, I think they come from constantly doubting myself. I replay past mistakes over and over, wondering if I should have done something differently. I also worry a lot about the future—what if I fail? What if I disappoint everyone? It's like my mind is stuck in a loop of 'what-ifs' and regrets, and I can't seem to break free from it." | "I'm so sorry to hear that you're experiencing feelings of distance and isolation, even when you're with loved ones. It takes a lot of courage to share this with me, and I want you to know that I'm here to listen and support you. It sounds like you've had some negative experiences in the past where you tried to express your feelings, but they weren't received well. That can be incredibly hurtful and isolating. It's no wonder you're struggling to open up now. I'd like to explore this further. Can you tell me more about what it was like when you tried to express yourself in the past? What did the people around you say or do that made you feel dismissed or like a burden? Also, I want to acknowledge the negative thoughts you're experiencing. It sounds like you're beating yourself up over past mistakes and worrying about the future. That can be a heavy burden to carry. I'm here to tell you that it's okay to make mistakes, and it's okay to not have all the answers. We can work on developing some coping strategies to help you manage those thoughts and feelings. Based on your input, I think we've reached a good stopping point for this stage of our conversation. I'd like to transition to a new stage where we can start exploring some of these issues in more depth.

| "I think the main problem is that I've built this habit of keeping everything inside because I'm afraid of being misunderstood or dismissed. In the past, when I opened up, people either minimized my feelings or changed the subject, which made me feel like my emotions weren't valid. Over time, I just stopped trying. Now, I feel stuck in this cycle where I don't share my thoughts, which makes me feel more alone, and then that loneliness makes my negative thoughts even worse. I constantly doubt myself, overanalyze past mistakes, and worry about the future to the point where it's exhausting. So, what exactly is wrong with me? Why do I feel this way? And more importantly, how do I fix it? How can I break this pattern and stop feeling so disconnected?" | "Thank you for sharing your concerns with me. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the feelings of loneliness and disconnection you're experiencing, and I'm here to support you. It sounds like you've been carrying this weight of emotions inside for a while, and it's affecting your daily life. Firstly, let's acknowledge that it's not uncommon for people to build walls around themselves due to past experiences of being misunderstood or dismissed. It's a natural coping mechanism to protect yourself from the fear of being hurt again. However, it's clear that this pattern is now causing more harm than good. Feeling stuck, alone, and disconnected can be overwhelming and exhausting. It's essential to recognize that your emotions are valid, and it's okay to feel this way. Before we dive deeper, I'd like to acknowledge that it's not necessarily about what's 'wrong' with you. It's about understanding the underlying patterns and feelings that are driving your thoughts and behaviors. We can work together to explore these patterns and find ways to break the cycle of disconnection. In our next conversation, I'd like to explore the following topics: 1. How past experiences have shaped your current behaviors and emotions. 2. What are some triggers that make you feel like you're stuck in this pattern? 3. What small steps can you take to start reconnecting with others and sharing your thoughts and feelings? Are you comfortable with this direction? If so, let's move forward and work together to find ways to address your concerns." | 0.75                   | 0.75            | `get_relevant_context: 0.06s, 604 tokens`<br>`summarize_conversation: 1.18s, 208 tokens`<br>`chain_invoke: 0.97s, 327 tokens` |
| "I understand what you're saying, and I do want to break this cycle, but I don't know where to start. Every time I try to open up, I shut down, convinced that no one will understand. My past experiences of feeling unheard make me assume that will always be the case, and my biggest triggers are moments when I feel unneeded or when others seem too busy, reinforcing the belief that my feelings don't matter. But I don't want to feel this way forever—I want to change. What concrete steps can I take to reconnect with people and express myself without feeling like a burden?" | "I completely understand your concerns and fears. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge the need for change and to want to break the cycle of disconnection. I'm here to support you in taking those first steps. To start, let's identify what's holding you back from opening up and expressing yourself. It seems like your past experiences have led you to assume that your feelings won't be understood or valued. We can work on reframing those assumptions and building a sense of trust. One concrete step we can take is to explore healthy communication skills. This could include practicing active listening, asking clarifying questions, and expressing yourself in a way that feels authentic and safe. We can also work on developing coping skills, such as mindfulness and deep breathing, to help manage strong emotions. In terms of reconnecting with people, we can start by identifying small, manageable steps. This might involve sharing your thoughts and feelings with a trusted friend or family member, or even just starting a journal to process your emotions. Let's take it one step at a time, and I'll be here to support you every step of the way. What do you think? Is there a particular area you'd like to focus on first?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 0.6                    | 0.6             | `get_relevant_context: 0.05s, 288 tokens`<br>`summarize_conversation: 1.19s, 192 tokens`<br>`chain_invoke: 0.90s, 271 tokens` |

This can involve practicing active listening, expressing yourself assertively rather than aggressively, and seeking support from others.
